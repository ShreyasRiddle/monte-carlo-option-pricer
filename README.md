This project is an interactive Python web application that estimates the price of European call and put options using Monte Carlo simulation, and compares the result to the analytical Black-Scholes model. The app is built using Dash and Plotly, allowing users to input parameters such as initial stock price, strike price, time to maturity, volatility, and risk-free rate, and visualize simulated price paths and estimated payoffs. Under the hood, the simulation models asset prices using geometric Brownian motion and applies risk-neutral valuation to estimate expected payoff.
